title: About Tech+Earth
---

I’m concerned about the environment. I also geek out on software dev. You too? Right on.

This blog is about the intersection between tech and sustainabilty. Check back for interviews, case studies, and even the odd code examples by experts in the field of sustainability science, green building and building performance, ecology or just the average developer working on a project that might make a difference.

I  believe we can create a sustainable world, and at least part of that effort involves software and high-tech. Working on the cutting edge of technology is fun and potentially helpful, but only if our work includes humility, respect for the wisdom of our ancestors, and even an appreciation for the counter argument <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-green-tech-future-is-a-flawed-vision-of-sustainability-46681">that ‘green-tech’ is inherently flawed.</a>

My name is Daniel and I’m an <a href="http://www.mcquilleninteractive.com/">independent software developer</a> living in beautiful Hobart, Australia. I work on software applications that help make buildings more efficient, including the SEED project, COMFEN desktop application, SensorSuitcase project and ESTCP project, all for Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL). I'm also the lead developer on the <a href="https://courses.ibiology.org">iBiology Courses</a> team, bringing quality education to scientists. A long time ago I was one of the founding editors of the green building magazine Environmental Design & Construction, which I'm still quite proud of.
